# Water-Reminder
I almost had done my study project but felt that i need improove my skills in iOS development. For this i've chosen 3 project witch must improove me in UI(this project), Logic & Backend of iOS development. 
I chose use SwiftUI in this case because how i heard a lot of things do more eazyer here instead in UIKit, SwiftUI get more & more popular. But now i cannot say what better use, even for me. 
Maybe i'll be able say it after 2 yearsðŸ˜‚ because i know & learn UIKit longer than SwiftUI.
In one way or another, i wanna write next 2 apps with help SwiftUI.
 In this project i met with
 - View
 - Button
 - HStack, VStack, ZStack
 - Text
 - NavigationView
 - NavigationLink
 - Property Wrapper - it's really something unusual, interesting & scaring
 - Life cycle of View in SwiftUI - i don't like it, because UIKit has more methods: willApper, didLoad, willDisappear & etc.
 - For each
 - Shapes
 - ScrollView
